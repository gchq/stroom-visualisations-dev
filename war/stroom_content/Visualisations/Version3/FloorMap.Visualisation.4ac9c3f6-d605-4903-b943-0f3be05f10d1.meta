  "description" : "\nA visualisation that can display locations of data on a floorplan.\n\nThere can be a number of floorplans per building, a number of buildings per building group and there can be a number of building groups defined (e.g. one per campus).\n\nIt is necessary to configure FloorMap with configuration for your installation but it is usually easier to create a local floormap visualisation that is configured for your installation.\n\nThis can be achieved by cloning the stroom-visualisations-dev git repository, and following the instructions in stroom-content-local/builders/FloorMapLocalBuilder/README.md.\n\n\n            ",
